Here you find a few python scripts I made to make my animation life in Cinema 4D a little bit easier. They should work in C4D R16 and up, with the exception of glitchObj (for that one there's two seperate scripts, oe for r16 and one for r17). Use at your own risk. Let me know if you have any issues.
